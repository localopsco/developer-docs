title: Understanding roles
---

LocalOps simplifies the way you organise your team with four distinct roles: Administrator, Operations, Developer, and
QA. Pick a role when you invite someone into your LocalOps account, such that each member has the appropriate level of
access.

### 1. Administrator

- Has **unrestricted access** to all features and settings
- Can manage user permissions, App environment configurations, and all aspects of the LocalOps.

### 2. Operations

- **Read-write** access to all features except Account settings.
- Typically assigned to DevOps teams responsible for creating and managing App environments.

### 3. Developer

- **Read-write** access to all Sandbox environments, Apps, and Releases.
- **Read-only** access to Production environments, Environment templates, Sandbox Connections, and logs.
- Can make changes and updates to Apps.

### 4. QA

- **Read-write** access to all Sandbox environments.
- **Read-only** access to Apps, Releases, Sandbox connections, and templates.
- No access to Production environments.
- Can test, benchmark, and perform all tasks within Sandbox environments.
