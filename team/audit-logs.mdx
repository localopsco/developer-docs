title: Audit Log
---

In LocalOps, everyone in your account can easily track who created environments in which cloud account and who made
deployments. This ensures visibility and transparency within your team.

#### Using Audit Logs:

You can view all actions initiated across all your cloud accounts or your customers' cloud accounts (AWS/GCP/Azure) and
across all cloud regions using Audit logs.

### How It Works:

- **Accessing Audit Logs:** Navigate to the "Audit log" tab where you can see all actions done within your account.

- **Recording Actions:** We record and display the name of the user who triggered each action and the location from
  which the action was performed.

- Recorded Actions Include:

  - App creation, update, and deletion
  - Environment template creation, update, and deletion
  - Connection creation, update, and deletion
  - Release creation and deletion
  - Environment creation and deletion
  - App deployments
  - Sign-ins and sign-outs

- **Filtering Options:** You can filter these actions by User, App, Environment or Date to quickly find specific
  information.

- **Across Clouds:** Regardless of which cloud your environment is running in, all actions performed within your
  LocalOps account are recorded and visible in the Audit Log.

#### Note:

- **Audit Log Security:** No user can modify or delete entries in the Audit log.
- **Access:** Users with any role can view the Audit log.
