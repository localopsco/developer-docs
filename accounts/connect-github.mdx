title: Connect GitHub account
---

When you use LocalOps, your teams can simply push code to Github repositories to deploy them continuously on their
respective environments (staging, production, etc). To provide this push-to-deploy experience, you have to connect the
github org/account and its repositories.

We need `read-only` access to your github repositories.

### Steps to connect Github org or account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to LocalOps" />
  <Step title="Navigate to `Repositories` section" />
  <Step title="Click on `+ New Git connection" />
  <Step title="Follow the on-screen instructions from then to finish connecting your Github org" />
</Steps>

### How does this integration work?

You must connect your Github organisation or account first, by following above instructions.

From inside Github, either during the above integration process or after, you will give us read-only access to specific
git repositories. So that LocalOps can listen to all pushes you make on the repository to downlaod the code and deploy.

### Specific repositories

While configuring repositories, you can give access to only the specific repositories that has the code you want to
deploy. You can also restrict the level of access to `read-only`.
