<Update label="Jan 27th, 2025">
## See CloudWatch metrics/logs in one place

When we provision environment, we provision a Grafana dashboard specific to the environment, accessible at monitor.
`<your-app-env-domain>`. You can access metrics and logs of all nodes, pods and containers running within the app
environment's kubernetes cluster.

If you are running your environment in AWS, you will also see a pre-configured CloudWatch data source in the
corresponding Grafana dashboard. You can access logs and metrics that are stored in CloudWatch.

This is super useful if your application is using managed AWS services that are sending metrics/logs to CloudWatch.

Go to “Monitor” tab in your environment to access the Grafana dashboard. Within Grafana, see Connections > Data sources
to see the Cloudwatch data source. Click on “Explore” next to it to see CloudWatch logs and metrics.

<Update label="January 24th, 2025">
## Standard retention policy set on all logs and metrics

Every environment comes with its own unique instance of Loki + Prometheus + Grafana stack. From now, all logs and
metrics recorded by the monitoring stack have 30-day retention policy. Any log statement/metric data point is
automatically deleted after 30 days.

This significantly reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks when developers print sensitive information on logs by
accident.

## Access any AWS managed service using IAM Role

Your app container running inside environment can now access any AWS service using IAM roles. You don’t have to
configure any IAM key/credential as secrets in your application.

LocalOps sets up a default IAM role when your environment is provisioned in the target AWS account. We set things up in
your environment such that your application will be able to use this IAM role implicitly via AWS SDK, if you declare the
`ServiceAccount` in your Helm deployment yaml spec as per our documentation.

After the environment is provisioned, you can manually add/remove relevant IAM policies to the app specific IAM role we
provisioned earlier.

## Scale environments

![Scaling](./images/scaling-jan-14-25.png)

You can now scale up/down the underlying servers powering your environment, manually from within LocalOps console.

Visit “Scaling” tab in your environment page to pick a supported Node type (EC2 instance type in case of AWS) and save.
Existing worker nodes will be seamlessly replaced by new set of worker nodes.

You can also set a higher number of Node count. New worker nodes wll get provisioned automatically within a minute or
two.
