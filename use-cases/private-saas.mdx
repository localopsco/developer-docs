title: Private SaaS deployments / BYOC
description: Deploy your SaaS service on customer cloud environment
---

For SaaS vendors supporting enterprise customers, private deployments—also known as BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)—are
increasingly common. Enterprises often require applications to be deployed within their own cloud environments for data
residency, compliance, or security reasons.

LocalOps makes it simple to offer private SaaS deployments without reinventing your internal DevOps processes for each
customer.

### What Is a BYOC Deployment?

In a BYOC model, your application is installed inside the customer’s own AWS, GCP, or Azure account. You provide the
software, but the infrastructure is owned and controlled by the customer.

This approach is typically used to meet requirements such as:

- Customer data must remain within their account
- Isolation from other tenants for compliance
- No shared infrastructure between customers
- Support for air-gapped or private network environments

### How LocalOps Helps

LocalOps provides an out-of-the-box solution for provisioning, deploying, and managing your SaaS product inside customer
cloud accounts:

- Standardized environments: Define your infrastructure once (networking, compute, storage, IAM policies) and reuse it
  across customers.
- Security best practices: Each environment is provisioned with hardened defaults, reducing the risk of
  misconfigurations.
- GitOps-compatible: Your application can be deployed and updated through version-controlled workflows, ensuring
  consistency and auditability.
- Region-aware provisioning: Deploy to the customer’s region of choice while maintaining your base configuration and
  policies.
- Auto-healing and scaling: Private environments benefit from the same self-managing capabilities as centralized
  environments.

### Common Use Cases

- Enterprise customers requesting in-account installations for privacy or regulatory reasons
- AI/ML workloads where customers want control over GPU usage or data locality
- Healthcare or finance verticals requiring strict compliance boundaries

### Outcome

Using LocalOps for BYOC allows you to serve high-value enterprise customers without increasing your DevOps burden. You
can deliver your SaaS as-a-service—running in their environment—while still maintaining control over the deployment and
upgrade process.

This helps reduce sales friction, meet compliance needs, and expand into regulated industries without a full rewrite of
your infrastructure tooling.
