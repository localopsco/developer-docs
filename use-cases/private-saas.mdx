title: Private SaaS deployments
---

While SaaS is popular, there are a category of customers who cannot signup for SaaS because of limitations in privacy,
security, reliability and shared performance bottlenecks in a typical SaaS environment.

These customers of yours need your application running in their cloud for maximum data privacy, control over data
security, data soverignity and performance. This is called as Private SaaS deployment or Cloud-prem deployments.

LocalOps is used to deliver applications to such customers.

## How to make Private SaaS deployment:

1. End Customers connect their cloud with LocalOps
2. From inside LocalOps account, you (the developer) spin up an App environment on the specific cloud connection to
   provision and deploy your application on customer's cloud account.
3. Setup a custom domain

We will cover each steps one by one.

### Step 1: End customers connect their cloud

Follow instructions in [connecting cloud account](/accounts/aws#to-your-customer-cloud-account) guide to get your
customer account connected with LocalOps.

<Info>
  If you are deploying to AWS, we recommend you ask end-customers to create a separate AWS sub account and provide you
  access to the new sub account. This will isolate your cloud resources from their other applications.

### Step 2: Create app environment

You (the developer) use the connection created above and create a new App environment from App environments tab. Refer
to [this guide](/bring-your-helm-chart/manage-apps#create-an-app). Pick "Private delivery" as environment type when
asked.

### Step 3: Setup a custom domain

After App environment is created, you can set a custom domain like your-app.customerdomain.com on it and share it with
your end customer to access. Refer to [this guide](/bring-your-helm-chart/custom-domains/attach-custom-domain) to learn
more.
