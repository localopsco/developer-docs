LocalOps is used to get your public SaaS production environment in your cloud account.

## How to Provision a production SaaS environment

1. Designate a cloud account that belongs to you, to host public SaaS infrastructure.
2. Get credentials of the cloud account and record them inside your LocalOps account as Connection.
3. Spin up an App environment on the specific cloud connection to deploy your application.
4. Setup a custom domain.

### Step 1 - Designate a cloud account

Decide and designate the cloud account where you would want to host production Public SaaS infrastructure.

### Step 2 - Create a connection

_Skip this step if the designated cloud account is already added as connection._

Follow all the steps provided in [connecting cloud account](/accounts/aws) guide to create a cloud connection.

### Step 3 - Spin up an App environment

Use the connection created above and create a new App environment from App environments tab. Refer to
[this guide](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9584120-creating-first-environment). Pick "SaaS Production" as
environment type when asked.

Every app environment provisions exclusive network, compute, kubernetes cluster in the cloud account, to run your app.

<Info>
  If you want to create US and EU regions for your SaaS, you can pick the corresponding region while creating the
  environment and repeat this process twice, say, once for US and once for EU.
