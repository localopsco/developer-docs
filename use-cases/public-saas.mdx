title: Public SaaS deployments
---

For teams building and operating public SaaS products, managing multiple environments—such as test, staging, and
production—alongside regional deployments (e.g., us-east, eu-central) can be challenging to scale and maintain.

LocalOps simplifies this with a unified workflow to provision, manage, and automate these environments using GitOps
principles and pre-secured defaults.

### Typical Setup

A standard public SaaS setup on LocalOps includes:

- **Test**: Used for developer testing and quick validation.
- **Staging**: Mirrors production for final validation before release.
- **Production**: Live environment for customer traffic.
- **Regional Variants**: e.g., prod-us, prod-eu, each isolated to comply with local data regulations.

All environments can be spun up in minutes.

Each environment is provisioned in your own cloud account, with built-in Monitoring stack, auto-scaling, security
hardening, and Git-based deployments configured out of the box.

### Benefits

- **Fast environment setup:** Fully reproducible via CLI or Git workflows.
- **Regional compliance:** Easily deploy in GDPR-compliant EU regions.
- **Cost efficiency:** Non-production environments auto-scale to reduce idle usage.
- **No vendor lock-in:** Use AWS, GCP, or Azure with the same workflow.
