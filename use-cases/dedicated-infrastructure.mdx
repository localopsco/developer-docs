title: Dedicated Infrastructure
---

Your customers may be pretty serious about data isolation, network isolation or compute isolation of their account.
Either for higher privacy, reliability or performance guarantees. They typically request to have their account running
within dedicated server infrastructure, even if their account is running in your cloud.

LocalOps is used to provision such dedicated infrastructure for these customers.

## How to provision Dedicated Infrastructure

1. Designate a cloud account that belongs to you, to host server infrastructure for the specific customer.
2. Get credentials of the cloud account and record them inside your LocalOps account as Connection.
3. From inside LocalOps account, spin up an App environment on the specific cloud connection to deploy your application.
4. Setup a custom domain.

### Step 1 - Designate a cloud account

Decide and designate the cloud account where you would want to host the dedicated server infrastructure for the
particular customer.

### Step 2 - Create a connection

_Skip this step if the designated cloud account is already added as connection._

Follow all the steps provided in [connecting cloud account](/accounts/aws) guide to create a cloud connection.

### Step 3 - Spin up an App Environment

Use the connection created above and create a new App environment from App environments tab. Refer to
[this guide](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9584120-creating-first-environment). Pick "Private delivery" as
environment type when asked.

Every app environment provisions exclusive network, compute, kubernetes cluster in the cloud account, to run your app.

### Step 4 - Setup a custom domain

After environment is created, you can set a custom domain like customer.yourdomain.com on it and share it with end
customer to use.
