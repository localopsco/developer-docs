title: Dedicated Infrastructure
description: Give dedicated isolated infrastrucure for specific customers
---

For SaaS companies working with mid-to-large enterprise customers, providing dedicated infrastructure—isolated
environments hosted in the vendor's cloud account—offers a strong middle ground between traditional multi-tenant SaaS
and full BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) deployments.

LocalOps enables you to provision and manage dedicated environments for each customer in your own cloud, without the
complexity of maintaining one-off stacks manually.

### What Is Vendor-Managed Dedicated Infrastructure?

In this model, the SaaS vendor hosts a separate instance of their product for each customer, running on isolated
infrastructure within the vendor's cloud account. It's ideal for:

- Customers who want data and compute isolation
- Regulated industries needing tenant-level segmentation
- High-throughput or high-security use cases
- Enterprise accounts that prefer not to share infrastructure with other tenants

Unlike BYOC, the vendor still owns and manages the cloud account and infrastructure—but each environment is logically
and physically isolated.

### How LocalOps Helps

LocalOps lets you scale dedicated deployments efficiently by treating each customer environment as a managed, versioned
unit:

- **Per-customer isolation:** Each environment has its own VPC, compute pool, and databases—ensuring no cross-tenant
  exposure.
- **Automated provisioning:** Environments are created from standardized templates, minimizing time-to-launch and manual
  effort.
- **Lifecycle management:** Easily handle upgrades, patching, and decommissioning across many customer environments.
- **Regional customization:** Choose cloud regions based on customer preferences or compliance requirements.
- **Operational visibility:** Monitor, log, and manage each customer stack independently with built-in observability.

### Common Use Cases

- Premium enterprise plans with dedicated infrastructure promises
- Customers requiring enhanced performance guarantees
- Deployment blueprints customized per vertical (e.g. finance, healthcare)
- SaaS vendors transitioning toward hybrid or regulated markets

### Outcome

With LocalOps, offering dedicated infrastructure becomes a repeatable process—not a custom project. You can scale to
dozens or hundreds of isolated environments, each tuned to a customer’s needs, while maintaining centralized control and
automation.

This approach improves customer trust, unlocks new market segments, and reduces churn risk—without bloating your DevOps
team.
