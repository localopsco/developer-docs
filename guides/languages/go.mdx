In this guide we will set up a Dockerfile for your Go Application.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker] to build standalone containers to serve your Go app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the above-mentioned technologies and tools. If you are not
  familiar with any of them, it is recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to speed
  before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Go HTTP Server

1. Run the command `go mod init go-http-server` to set up your project and manage its dependencies.
2. Now, create a file named `main.go` and add the following code to set up a basic http server using the
   [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

```go main.go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
			"message": "Hello, World!",
		})
	})

  // Default port 8080
	router.Run(":" + os.Getenv("APP_PORT"))
}
```

3. Export the required environment variables,

```shell
export APP_PORT=8080
```

4. Run `go mod download` command to download the required dependencies.
5. Run the command `go run main.go` to start the server.

## Dockerize

Dockerizing makes your app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform.

#### Create [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files)

Before creating the dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add that contents that should not be copied over
to the docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
bin/
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files)

<Info>
  Creating a `.dockerinogre` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is must, since dependencies will be installed
  while building the image based on the platform preferences used. Copying those from file system will overwrite the
  installed dependencies and might fail during deployments
</Info>

#### Create Dockerfile

Now, Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains
the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. Though docker supports
[Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) we won't be using that here. In this example
we will copy `source code` and build and run it inside the container. You can opt for multi stage build, if you want to
build the go binary in build stage and run it in another stage.

<Tip>
  Refer to this [doc](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/build-images/) to know more about building docker images
  for go applications.
</Tip>

```docker Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM golang:1.21

# Set destination for COPY
WORKDIR /app

# Download Go modules
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code.
COPY *.go ./

# Build
RUN GOOS=linux go build -o /go-http-server ./main.go

# Optional:
# To bind to a TCP port, runtime parameters must be supplied to the docker command.
# But we can document in the Dockerfile what ports
# the application is going to listen on by default.
# https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#expose
EXPOSE 8080

# Run
CMD ["/go-http-server"]
```

#### Build and test docker image

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t go-http-server .
```

This command builds the `go-http-server` image for platform `linux/amd64`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images

```bash
# only for testing in local machine
docker build -t go-http-server .
```

#### Run the docker image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created of the react application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name go-http-server \
  go-http-server
```

## Done ðŸŽ‰

You can now commit and push the Dockerfile to your git repo. [Create a service](/environment/services/create) now to
point at the git repository and branch name to deploy this image.
