title: Ember
---

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to prepare a Single Page Application (SPA) that was built using
Ember.js for deploying it in any cloud using LocalOps.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Node.js][node], v20.15.1 at the time of writing this doc.
- [npm] as a package manager for installing and maintaining dependencies. This usually comes bundled with Node.js.
- A foundational knowledge of [Ember.js][ember].
- [Nginx] to serve static assets and also act as a reverse proxy server.
- [Docker] to build standalone containers to serve your production app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the above-mentioned technologies and tools. If you are not
  familiar with any of them, it is highly recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to
  speed before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Installing the Ember CLI

You'll need to install Ember CLI to scaffold a new project. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g ember-cli
```

Check out the [Ember CLI docs](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/) for more info.

## Scaffolding the Ember app

In your terminal, run the CLI command `ember new` with the desired project name. In the following examples, we'll use
the example project name `ember-project`.

```bash
ember new <your project name> --lang en
```

Follow the prompts to create your first app. If you have more questions, check out the
[Quickstart guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/) to learn more about scaffolding the
app.

Once the application is ready, navigate to the directory and install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd ember-project # replace with the name of the project you created
```

All of your dependencies should be installed at this point (which you can verify by checking for the existence of a
`node_modules` folder in your project). You can start your project by running the command:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything is successful, you should see a similar confirmation message in your terminal:

```
Livereload server on http://localhost:7020
Serving on http://localhost:4200/
```

Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser of choice. You should see an Ember welcome page and not much else.

<Note>
Replace the `<WelcomePage />` component in `<rootDir>/app/templates/application.hbs` before building for
production with your app logic or something else to avoid errors while starting the application.
</Note>

## Building Your Production App

Now that we've written our application and verified that it works in development, it's time to get it ready to deploy to
our users.

```bash
npm run build
```

The `build` command packages up all of the assets that make up your applicationâ€”JavaScript, templates, CSS, web fonts,
images, and moreâ€”in an optimized way for production use.

import ConfigureNginx from '/snippets/configuring-nginx.mdx';

### Configuring nginx

<ConfigureNginx />

### Create the Docker Image

Dockerizing makes the app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform. As long as Docker is installed, whether it's Windows,
Mac, or Linux, it can run with the same behavior.

Before creating the Dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add the contents that should not be copied over
to the Docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).

<Note>
  Creating a `.dockerignore` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is a must since dependencies will be installed
  while building the image based on the platform preferences used. Copying those from the file system will overwrite the
  installed dependencies and might error out during deployment.
</Note>

Now, create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains
the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. We leverage Docker's
[Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to create a smaller-sized image for running
the production server.

```docker Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Base
# This stage is the first stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Switch to the app directory,
# this will be our app's root directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the manifest and lock file to the root
# Note: ./ refers to /app, since we switched context in the above step
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Set the NODE_ENV to production
# to configure the application to build/run under production mode
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy all the files from our machine to the container
COPY . .

# Run the build to create production assets
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
# Now we build a new stage from scratch to run the nginx server
# This won't include any images from the previous steps
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# The port you'd like to use for Nginx
ENV PORT=4200
# The URL for the backend service
ENV BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal
# Port for the backend
ENV BACKEND_PORT=4500

# Copy the template we created earlier for nginx to the etc folder
# note the destination file name should be default.conf.template
# else the variables in the config won't work
COPY nginx.conf.template /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template

# Since we started a new stage, we need to copy the build from the
# build step to the nginx's html directory. Note we have configured
# this directory in the nginx config file
COPY --from=base /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port the nginx is running to the outside world
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# Start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t ember-app:latest .
```

This command builds the `ember-app` image for platform `linux/amd64` and tags it as `latest`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images:

```bash
# only for testing on the local machine
docker build -t ember-app:latest .
```

### Run the Docker Image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created for the Ember application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --name ember-app \
  -e PORT=4200 \
  -e BACKEND_PORT=4500 \
  -e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -d \
  -p 4200:4200 \
  ember-app
```

- `-it`: enables interactivity with TTY
- `--rm`: tells the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits
- `--name ember-app`: Name of the container `ember-app`.
- `-e PORT=4200`: Sets the environment variable PORT in Docker to `4200`.
- `-e BACKEND_PORT=4500`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_PORT in Docker to `4500`.
- `-e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_HOST in Docker to
  `host.docker.internal`.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached (background) mode. You can skip the flag to see the logs directly in your
  terminal window.
- `-p 4200:4200`: Maps port 4200 on your host to port 4200 in the container.
- `ember-app` at the end is the name of the image.

The `-d` flag in Docker starts the container in the background. You can skip the flag to see the logs directly in your
terminal window.

After running the command, visit `http://localhost:4200` to see the Ember application running inside the Docker
container.

Hurray ðŸŽ‰. Now we have created and packaged an Ember app for production use.

## Done ðŸŽ‰

You can now commit and push the Dockerfile to your git repo. [Create a service](/environment/services/create) now to
point at the git repository and branch name to deploy this image.
