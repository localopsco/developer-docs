title: ReactJS
---

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to prepare a Single Page Application (SPA) that was built using ReactJS
for deploying it in any cloud using LocalOps.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Node.js][node], version 20.15.1 at the time of writing.
- [npm], as a package manager for installing and maintaining dependencies. This usually comes bundled with Node.js.
- A foundational knowledge of [React].
- [Vite] for a development server and building optimized static assets for production.
- [Nginx] to serve static assets and also act as a reverse proxy server.
- [Docker] to build standalone containers to serve your production app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the above-mentioned technologies and tools. If you are not
  familiar with any of them, it is recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to speed
  before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Scaffolding the React app

Vite offers a CLI tool that makes the scaffolding process much easier. Run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Follow the prompts to create your first app. Refer to the
[Vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to learn more about scaffolding the app.

Once the application is ready, navigate to the directory and install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd vite-project # replace with the name of the project you created
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the dev server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This usually starts the server on port `5173`. Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see your app.

The dev server is enabled with [HMR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#hot-module-replacement), so it hot reloads the
application when you make changes.

## Building Your Production App

When it is time to deploy your app for production, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds a highly optimized static bundle. By default, it uses `<root>/index.html` as the build entry point
and produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service. You can read more about
[building for production in the Vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#building-for-production).

The output is found in the `<root>/dist` directory unless configured to a different path.

<Tip>
  Once built, you can preview the production build using `npm run preview` to start a production-like local web server.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production
  server.
</Warning>

### Configuring nginx

### Create the Docker Image

Dockerizing makes the app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform. As long as Docker is installed, whether it's Windows,
Mac, or Linux, it can run with the same behavior.

Before creating the Dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add the contents that should not be copied over
to the Docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).

<Important>
  Creating a `.dockerignore` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is a must, since dependencies will be installed
  while building the image based on the platform preferences used. Copying those from the file system will overwrite the
  installed dependencies and might cause errors during deployment.
</Important>

Now, create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains
the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. We leverage Docker's
[Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to create a smaller-sized image for running
the production server.

```docker Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Base
# This stage is the first stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Switch to the app directory,
# this will be our app's root directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the manifest and lock file to the root
# Note: ./ refers to /app, since we switched context in the above step
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Set the NODE_ENV to production
# to configure the application to build/run under production mode
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy all the files from our machine to the container
COPY . .

# Run the build to create production assets
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
# Now we build a new stage from scratch to run the nginx server
# This won't include any images from the previous steps
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# The port you'd like to use for Nginx
ENV PORT=3000
# The URL for the backend service. Skip if irrelevant to you.
ENV BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal
# Port for the backend. Skip if irrelevant to you.
ENV BACKEND_PORT=3001

# Copy the template we created earlier for nginx to the etc folder
# note the destination file name should be default.conf.template
# else the variables in the config won't work
COPY nginx.conf.template /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template

# Since we started a new stage, we need to copy the build from the
# build step to the nginx's html directory. Note we have configured
# this directory in the nginx config file
COPY --from=base /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port the nginx is running to the outside world
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# Start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t react-app:latest .
```

This command builds the `react-app` image for the platform `linux/amd64` and tags it as `latest`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images.

```bash
# only for testing in a local machine
docker build -t react-app:latest .
```

### Run the Docker Image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created of the React application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --name react-app \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e BACKEND_PORT=3001 \
  -e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  react-app
```

- `-it`: enables interactivity with TTY.
- `--rm`: tells the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits.
- `--name react-app`: Name of the container `react-app`.
- `-e PORT=3000`: Sets the environment variable PORT in Docker to `3000`.
- `-e BACKEND_PORT=3001`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_PORT in Docker to `3001`.
- `-e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_HOST in Docker to
  `host.docker.internal`.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached (background) mode. You can skip the flag to see the logs directly in your
  terminal window.
- `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.
- `react-app` at the end is the name of the image.

After running the command, visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the React application running inside the Docker
container.

Hurray ðŸŽ‰. Now we have created and packaged a React app for production use.

## Example app

```text
Source: https://github.com/localopsco/js-example-spa
```

`js-example-spa` is an example TODO app built with. This project is dockerized and the images are published to Amazon
Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## Done ðŸŽ‰

You can now commit and push the Dockerfile to your git repo. [Create a service](/environment/services/create) now to
point at the git repository and branch name to deploy this image.
