There are two ways to install LocalOps cli in a windows machine

- [Using WSL](#using-wsl)
- [Downloading Binaries](#downloading-binaries)

## Using WSL

WSL is a feature developed by Microsoft that allows you to run a Linux distribution on your Windows machine. This
feature is supported on Windows 10 and above. For older versions of windows, you may have to
[install it manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).

### Install WSL

You can choose your choice of linux distro, in this example, we will be using ubunutu. Open PowerShell or Windows
Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", enter the following command

```bash
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```

<Note>You'll need to restart your machine after the installation</Note>

Checkout [Official WSL docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more info.

After the reboot, run the command from your PowerShell

```bash
wsl
```

Once you have installed WSL, you will need to create a user account and password for your newly installed Linux
distribution.

<Note>This user is not same as windows user.</Note>

### Install CLI

Once you have everything up and running, you can install LocalOps CLI by following the instructions from the
[Install Linux](/cli/install-linux) page. Since we are running a linux distribution on a windows machine, steps are the
same.

## Downloading Binaries

You can download the binaries and execute them. Downlod links for

- [Windows arm64](https://github.com/localopsco/lops-cli/releases/latest/download/lops-windows-arm64.zip)

### Verify installation

You can verify the isntallation by running the ops executable

```bash
ops.exe version
```

This should print the cli version which confirms that LocalOps CLI is sucessfully installed ðŸš€
