Integrating custom domains into App Environments provides personalized and professional web addresses. LocalOps enhances
security by automatically applying SSL protection to all configured custom domains, ensuring encrypted web traffic by
default.

## Common Issues with Adding Custom Domains

### Custom Domain Verification Failure

After saving your custom domain, you will receive three CNAME records to add to your domain's DNS settings. It typically
takes a few minutes for these DNS settings to propagate, although in some cases, it may take up to 24 hours. If you
attempt to verify and deploy the custom domain immediately after saving, you may encounter a "Verification failed"
error. In such instances, please wait a few additional minutes and try verification again.

### Incorrect CNAME Records

If custom domain verification continues to fail even after waiting, verify that the provided CNAME records are
accurately added to your domain's DNS settings.

### Using a Shorter TTL

If correctly configured CNAME records still experience delays in verification, consider deleting the existing CNAME
records and creating new ones with a Time-to-Live (TTL) of 60 seconds. This shorter TTL can expedite the verification
process for your custom domain.
