In this article we can go through troubleshoot steps for most commonly faced issues during Environment creation and
deletion.

## Infra limit reached

AWS imposes limits on the number of resources that can be created for a specific type. For example, by default, only 5
Elastic IPs (EIPs) are allowed per AWS account per region. If this limit is reached, the Environment creation operation
may fail with an error indicating that the maximum allowed limit has been reached.

To resolve this issue, you can either clean up unused resources in the target AWS account or contact AWS Support to
request an increase in the resource limit, explaining your use case.

## Creation Issues

If creating infrastructure resources step fails, you can check the operation logs to understand the cause of the
failure. Take appropriate actions based on the logs and retry the operation to resolve the issue. Sometimes,
infrastructure creation failures may occur due to temporary issues on the AWS side. Retrying the operation often
resolves such issues.

## Deletion Issues

During environment deletion, you may encounter errors related to AWS resources not being deleted. This can occur if
dependent resources are not fully deleted. While AWS typically handles cascading deletes automatically, there are cases
where this process fails, leaving dangling resources that prevent deletion of the environment.

In such situations, manually delete the resources from your AWS console and retry the deletion operation. Sometimes,
delays or glitches on the AWS side can also contribute to deletion failures. Retrying the deletion operation usually
resolves these issues.

<Tip>
  To ensure all resources are properly deleted, use the provided Environment tags to filter AWS resources and confirm
  their removal. This helps maintain a clean and efficient AWS environment.
