Each Application environment comprises

**Classic VPC setup**

- Dedicated Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Private subnets
- Public subnets
- NAT gateway
- Internet gateway

**Managed kubernetes cluster**

- Cloud managed Kubernetes cluster (E.g., EKS in AWS)
- Compute servers and their default volumes (E.g., EC2 in AWS)
- Kubernetes components
  - Prometheus
  - Loki
  - Grafana
- ELB (Elastic load balancer) for receiving all in-bound HTTP traffic
- ðŸ‘‰ Your App

Let us go over each of them in detail.

### Dedicated Virtual private cloud (VPC)

In any connected cloud account, a dedicated network is provisioned to host everything for a given environment.

In AWS, LocalOps provisions a VPC (Virtual private cloud).

### Private subnets

Within the dedicated network / VPC, LocalOps creates private subnets to host data in servers having no public IP.

### Public subnets

Similar to private subnets, LocalOps creates public subnets to host servers having public IP. For example, Internet
gateway.

### NAT gateway

In AWS, NAT Gateway and a persistent IP (elastic IP) is provisioned inside public subnet in each app environemnt for
private subnet servers to connect to the internet. To the internet, all requests originating from private subnet servers
will pass via NAT gateway and have NAT gateway's persistent IP address.

### Internet gateway

In AWS, Internet Gateway and a persistent IP (elastic IP) is provisioned inside public subnet in each app environemnt
for all servers in the VPC to connect to the internet.

### Kubernetes cluster

A kubernetes cluster and control plane is provisioned inside each VPC for every environment. This cluster runs the
application deployed on the environment.

In AWS, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is provisioned to ensure AWS managas the configure and uptime of Kubernetes
control plane.

### Compute servers

To run your application's containers, compute servers are provisioned and attached to the kubernetes clusters as Nodes.

In AWS, EC2 servers are provisioned. Count and type of EC2 servers depends on the environment template chosen to create
the environment. Any type of EC2 servers [supported by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) can be
provisioned. Also, EBS Volumes are attached by default to each of these EC2 servers. But, the applications deployed on
Kubernetes cluster (your app) will dynamically create volumes matching your storage specifications declared in Helm
chart.

## Kubernetes companion deployments

### Prometheus

Open source [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is installed and pre-configured by LocalOps in an Environment to record
system metrics of the compute nodes.

### Loki

Open source [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is installed and pre-configured by LocalOps in an environment to
record logs of your application.

### Grafana

Open source [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) is installed and pre-configured by LocalOps in an app
environment to store logs and metrics from your environment and let you visualise them in a single dashboard.

## Your services

Your code is run as Services.
