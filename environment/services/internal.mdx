title: Internal service
---

An Internal service is a lot like Web service, but it is not exposed to public internet. It is available to get used
from within the environment by other services.

#### Port

When you [create a service](/environment/services/create), you must provide `port` number where your Dockerfile exposes
the running code.

#### Number of replicas

For redundancy, ensure you set at least 2 as the number of replicas. This is a best practice yet you can enter 1 if it
better suits your use case.

#### No downtime deployments

All deployments are no-downtime deployments. When LocalOps deploys your code, it brings up new containers with new code
first. If they become healthy, old containers will be stopped.

#### Logs

You can see logs of running containers via the in-built Grafana dashboard. Navigate to Monitor tab to login to Grafana
dashboard. Within Grafana dashboard, filter to see `app-services` namespace logs.

You can create any number of internal services to suit your application architecture. All of the above will be
applicable for each of them.
