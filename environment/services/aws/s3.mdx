title: S3
---

You service(s) may want to store/access files in S3. This guide will show you steps to create and access s3 buckets from
your services.

To proceed with this guide, you would need access to:

1. AWS console with permissions to create s3 buckets and add policies to an existing IAM role.
2. LocalOps console

## Steps:

### 1. Create S3 bucket

Login to AWS console and create new S3 bucket(s) in the region you want, and with appopriate unique name.

You can follow this
[official AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html#creating-bucket) to
create s3 buckets.

### 2. Add permission to access S3 bucket

LocalOps creates a new IAM role in your AWS account for your services/containers to use. So that your code/containers
can access any AWS resource without passing AWS_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY.

Navigate to LocalOps console and the corresponding environment. In overview section, you can find the APP ROLE whose
name ends with `app-role` and that which you can copy and search in AWS IAM console > Roles section. Once you find the
IAM role in IAM console, next step is to add a policy to the IAM role to give permissions for the role to access the S3
bucket your created.

#### Create a new IAM policy for the S3 bucket:

1. Navigate to Policies in AWS IAM console
2. Create a new IAM policy and give it a specific name
3. Add the JSON below, as policy statement:

```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:DeleteObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
```

Replace `your-bucket-name` with your bucket name. 4. Press save.

#### Add the new IAM policy to the IAM role

Navigate back to the IAM role you saw earlier. In its Permissions tab, pick the option to "Add Policy". In the policy
picker, pick the one you created above and add it.

### 3. Add bucket details as secret

Last step is to tell your service about the new S3 bucket it can start to access. In LocalOps console, navigate the
Service settings within the corresponding environment.

In secrets section, add a new key value pair like

```
- Key: `attachments-bucket`
- Value: `your-bucket-name`
```

Learn more about secrets [here](/environment/services/secrets).

You can name the key in any way you want. In your code, you can access `attachments-bucket` environment variable to get
the name of the bucket you created. This can be passed to the AWS SDK used in your code to read/write data. There is no
need to provide credentials like access key since we are having role based access control here.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
