title: SQS
---

Amazon SQS offers fully managed FIFO / standard queues. You service(s) may want to add items/jobs/messages to a queue
and process them later. This guide will show you steps to create and access Amazon SQS queues from your services.

To proceed with this guide, you would need access to:

1. AWS console with permissions to create SQS queues and add policies to an existing IAM role.
2. LocalOps console

## Steps:

### 1. Create SQS queue

Login to AWS console and create new SQS queue in the region you want, and with appopriate unique name.

You can follow this
[official AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/creating-sqs-standard-queues.html)
to create a sqs queue.

### 2. Add permission to access SQS queue

LocalOps creates a new IAM role in your AWS account for your services/containers to use. So that your code/containers
can access any AWS resource without passing AWS_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY.

Navigate to LocalOps console and the corresponding environment. In overview section, you can find the APP ROLE whose
name ends with `app-role` and that which you can copy and search in AWS IAM console > Roles section. Once you find the
IAM role in IAM console, next step is to add a policy to the IAM role to give permissions for the role to access the SQS
queue your created.

#### Create a new IAM policy for the SQS queue:

1. Navigate to Policies in AWS IAM console
2. Create a new IAM policy and give it a specific name
3. Add the JSON below, as policy statement:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
        "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility"
      ],
      "Resource": "<queue-arn>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `<queue-arn>` with your SQS queue's ARN.

If you create more than one queue, expand the `Resource` attribute above to an array of ARN strings.

4. Press save.

#### Add the new IAM policy to the IAM role

Navigate back to the IAM role you saw earlier. In its Permissions tab, pick the option to "Add Policy". In the policy
picker, pick the one you created above and add it.

### 3. Add queue details as secret

Last step is to give service access to the new SQS queue. In LocalOps console, navigate to the Service settings within
the corresponding environment.

In secrets section, add a new key value pair like

```
- Key: `queue-var-name`
- Value: `queue-name`
```

Repeat this for each queue you created. Learn more about secrets [here](/environment/services/secrets).

You can name the key in any way you want. In your code, you can access `queue-var-name` environment variable to get the
name of the queue you created. This can be passed to the AWS SDK used in your code to read/write data. There is no need
to provide credentials like access key since we are having role based access control here.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
