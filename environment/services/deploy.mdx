title: Deploy a service
---

Deployment can be started for a service either manually from LocalOps console or by pushing new code to the configured
service repo and branch name.

### Automatic deployment

This is written for a GitHub repository. Same steps are applicable for almost all git providers.

If you have a local development environment for the git repository configured for the given service, you can simply
follow these steps to start deployment.

```sh
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ ..add commits
$ git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

If your GitHub organization doesn't allow direct git push on the branch, you can ask your team to raise pull requests
(PRs) targeting the configured branch name of the service. If you merge the PR, a new deployment will start in LocalOps
with the latest commit on that branch.

Or if you directly edit files in Github website and make new commits on the configured branch name of the service, a new
deployment will start.

A new deployment will start in either of these cases. Navigate to "Deployments" tab within the same service section to
see the logs.
