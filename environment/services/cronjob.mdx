---

A Cron job service is like a Job service. It spins up the specific container on a given schedule.

#### Run command

When you [create a service](/environment/services/create), you must provide appropriate `Run command` if your Dockerfile
`CMD` doesn't point at the job script.

#### Cron schedule

Specify a cron schedule like `5 4 * * *`. Refer to https://crontab.guru/ for the syntax to specify your schedule.

#### Logs

Yan can see logs of the job via the in-built Grafana dashboard. Navigate to Monitor tab to login to Grafana dashboard.
Within Grafana dashboard, filter to see `app-services` namespace logs.

You can create any number of jobs in your environment.
