A job service is a one off container that comes up to run a specific logic once and shuts down.

When you [create a service](/environment/services/create), you must provide appropriate `Run command` if your Dockerfile
`CMD` doesn't point at the job script.

#### Logs

You can see logs of the job via the in-built Grafana dashboard. Navigate to Monitor tab to login to Grafana dashboard.
Within Grafana dashboard, filter to see `app-services` namespace logs.

You can create any number of jobs in your environment.
