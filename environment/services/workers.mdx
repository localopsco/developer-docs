title: Workers
---

A worker is a lot like an internal service that runs continuously yet doesn't expose any service publicly or privately.

#### Number of replicas

For redundancy, ensure you set at least 2 as the number of replicas. This is a best practice yet you can enter 1 if it
better suits your use case.

#### No downtime deployments

All deployments are no-downtime deployments. When LocalOps deploys your code, it brings up new containers with new code
first. If they become healthy, old containers will be stopped.

#### Logs

You can see logs of running worker containers via the in-built Grafana dashboard. Navigate to Monitor tab to login to
Grafana dashboard. Within Grafana dashboard, filter to see `app-services` namespace logs.

You can create any number of worker services to suit your application architecture. All of the above will be applicable
for each of them.
