title: Web service
---

A web service is a service that you want to expose to the public internet, using a public domain and SSL cert. Your
users can interact with this service from amywhere.

#### Port

When you [create a service](/environment/services/create), you must provide `port` number where your Dockerfile exposes
the running code.

#### Public domain and SSL cert

A public domain will be assigned by LocalOps by default. And a auto-renewing SSL cert will be provisioned for the
domain. You can setup a custom domain for the service to suit your brand.

#### Number of replicas

For redundancy, ensure you set at least 2 as the number of replicas. This is a best practice yet you can enter 1 if it
better suits your usecase.

#### No downtime deployments

All deployments are no-downtime deployments. When LocalOps deploys your code, it brings up new containers with new code
first. If they become healthy, old containers will be stopped.

#### Logs

Yan can see logs of running containers via the in-built Grafana dashboard. Navigate to Monitor tab to login to Grafana
dashboard. Within Grafana dashboard, filter to see `app-services` namespace logs.

You can create any number of publicly facing web services. All of the above will be applicable for each of them.
