description: Learn how to create a new service
---

To create a new service, sign in to your LocalOps account and follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the environment where you want the service to run
2. Go to "Services" tab
3. Click on "+ Add new service" tile
4. Provide service details like Name, Kind, Source repo & branch name, Dockerfile location and run command.
5. Give port, number of containers and any other details required there
6. Provide secrets necessary to run your container
7. Click "Create service"

### Source repo & branch name:

If you have [connected your GitHub org/account](/accounts/connect-github), you will be able to pick a repository and its
corresponding branch name here. When your devs push to this branch, a new deployment will automatically get triggered.

<Tip>
  You can choose to turn off automatic deployments. In this case, you can only trigger deployments from within LocalOps
  console. This is useful if you are deploying to a customer specific standalone environment, and if you need approvals
  to deploy new changes.
</Tip>

### Dockerfile location

You can specify the file location within your repository where we can find the Dockerfile. If the Dockerfile is present
in a non-root directory, you can specify the name of the directory here. Example values - (empty) or `build` or `worker`
or `app`, etc.,

This is optional. Default is `` - empty string, which means Dockerfile will be expected at the root of your git repo.

This is to accommodate the case of mono-repos where you might have more than one component's codebases in the same git
repo.

### Run command

You can specify the run command as well. If your Dockerfile has a `CMD` directive, then that will get used by default.
If you specific a differnet run command here in the form, it will be used instad of the `CMD` directive specified in the
DOckerfile.

This is also done to accomodate the case of mono-repos where you might have more than one component's codebase in the
same git repo. You can have scripts of jobs/crons in the same repo. In these cases, you can use the same `Dockerfile`
but a different `CMD` to run for your service.

This is optional. Default is - `CMD` that is specified in your Dockerfile.

### Number of containers

Specify the number of copies of your codebase / containers to run. You can define any number from 1 to 99 to support
your traffic.

### CPU and memory requirements for each container

Define the minimum CPU and memory requirements to run each container. Service containers will be scheduled to run on the
underlying compute servers as appropriate.

You can also define the max CPU and max memory here. When any container crosses this limit, it will be re-booted.

<Tip>Specifying max CPU and max Memory is a neat trick to catch memory leaks and restart containers</Tip>

### Other details

You can fill out other service specific details like Port (for internal or web service), Cron schedule (for cron
service), and so on.

### How to deploy

Containers of the service won't start to run until you make a new deployment. Click on "Deploy" button on the top right
corner to start a manual deployments. Otherwise, if you push new commits to the configured branch above, a new
deployment will get triggered. Learn more at [Deploy service](/environment/services/deploy) guide.
