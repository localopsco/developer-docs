title: Custom domain
---

[LocalOps] offers its customers the convenience of adding custom domains to their Environments, allowing for
personalized and professional web addresses. Additionally, LocalOps ensures that every configured custom domain is
automatically protected with **SSL**, providing enhanced security and encryption for your web traffic by default. This
seamless integration of custom domains with **SSL protection** ensures that your application not only stands out with a
unique domain but also adheres to best practices in security and trustworthiness.

<Warning>
  After successfully attaching a custom domain, users will no longer be able to access their environment using the
  default URL generated by LocalOps. From that point forward, users must use the custom domain to access their [App
  Environment].
</Warning>

## Steps

### 1. Add your domain

1. [Login] to your LocalOps account, if you do not have LocalOps account already then [signup here]
2. Go to [environment] list page and click on the environment for which you have to configure custom domain.
   <Note>
     You will need to have a running environment for which you will be adding a Custom Domain. If you do not have an
     environment running already then follow [this
     article](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9582075-app-environments) to create one.
   </Note>
3. Click on **Custom Domain** tab to open custom domain settings section.
4. In the custom domain settings section, you will find the environment current domain and a **"Change domain"** button.
5. Click on the **"Change domain"** button and type in your custom domain in the text box.
6. Click **"Save"**.

Clicking **"Save"** button will give you DNS records to add to your domain DNS settings (refer below screenshot).

In next step, we will use these DNS records to verify the ownership of your domain and to route traffic from your domain
to your environment.

### 2. Verify your domain

In this step you will verify the ownership of your domain by adding a **CNAME records** to your DNS settings. And
additionally you will be adding 2 more **CNAME records** to your DNS settings to route traffic from your domain to your
LocalOps environment. So on total you will be adding **3** CNAME records to your DNS settings to setup custom domain for
your environment.

Please refer below screenshot to know the purpose of each **CNAME records**.

<Warning>
  After saving the DNS settings, usaully it takes few minutes for the newly added DNS settings to propagate, sometimes
  it may also take up to 24 hours.
</Warning>

### 3. Deploy

Once you have added the given **CNAME records** to your domain's DNS settings give it few minutes for the DNS settings
to propagate. Then click on **"Verify and deploy"** button.

<Tip>
  If domain verification fails then give it few more minutes for the newly updated DNS settings to propagate and try
  again. If it still fails then check whether you have properly configured the given **CNAME records** in your domain's
  DNS settings.
</Tip>

Once the domain verification is successful, system will automatically create an **Op** (Operation) on the chosen [App
Environment] to deploy the newly configured **Custom Domain**. Wait for the op to complete.

After the **Op** is successful, your environment's URL will be updated and you can verify it by loading your custom
domain in a browser tab to check whether it loads your app that is running in LocalOps environment.

**Hurrey! You have successfully setup Custom Domain for your Environment.** ðŸŽ‰
