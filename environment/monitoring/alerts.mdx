title: Alerts
---

Every environment comes pre-installed with open source Grafana.

- Logs & metrics from your app and environment are recorded by Loki & Prometheus and sent to the corresponding Grafana
  installation running within the same cluster.
- Each grafana installation gets its own domain and URL so that your team can login and configure views, dashboards and
  alerting as needed for that specific environment.

<Info>
  Grafana has an extensive guide on how to configure Alerting. [Please refer to their
  guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/) to learn more and configure them as you see fit for your
  team and for each environment.{' '}
</Info>

You can login to an environment's grafana dashboard from Monitoring tab of the environment, from within LocalOps
dashboard.
