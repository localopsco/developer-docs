title: Logs
---

Every environment comes pre-installed with its own instance of open source [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) and
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/). Grafana will be running on its own URL for each environment and must be used to see
all logs collected from your environment.

_Grafana is simple to use yet very powerful in how you can customise the setup for yourself._

### Print logs

Your application should be printing logs to STDOUT or STDERR. These logs will be collected automatically by pre-install
Loki and kept available for you to view inside Grafana dashboard.

### See logs

Grafana dashboard can be opened from Monitoring tab, in Environment page.

Logs are collected and kept organised under a Kubernetes namespace. Your application is hosted in a specific Kuberntes
namespace using which you can filter and see logs under Explore section.

### Custom dashboards

Grafana installation in each environment comes with pre-built dashboards to see infrastructure/system metrics. You can
create new dashboards to see logs from different deployments/services in your application as needed.
