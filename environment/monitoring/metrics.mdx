title: Metrics
---

Every environment comes pre-installed with open source [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/). Grafana will be running on its own URL for each environment and must be used to see
all metrics collected from your environment.

_Grafana is simple to use yet very powerful in how you can customise the setup for yourself._

### Recording metrics

CPU, memory, disk and network metrics from each node running your app, inside kubernetes, is recorded by prometheus and
sent to Grafana for your visibility.

### See metrics

Grafana installation of the specific environment can be opened from Monitoring tab of Environment page.

Inside grafana, you can group and see CPU/Memory/Disk/Network metrics by:

- node
- pod
- deployment
- service
- namespace

### In-built dashboards

Grafana installation in each environment comes with a lot of pre-built dashboards to see infrastructure/system metrics.
You can star the frequently visited ones for convenience.

### Custom dashboards

You can create new dashboards within the specific Grafana isntallation to see metrics from different node, in your
application as needed.
