We don't recommend crashes to be recorded and seen at an App environment level as it will be too fragmented for your
team to manage. So you can signup for a crash reporting service and use it as your central store for recording crashes.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) is the most popular choice today. There are also other prominent tools like
[BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) which you can explore and decide if they will be a better fit for your team.

You can signup for an account in one of these services and embed their sdk in Front-end and Back-end codebase to record
crashes. Every unique application you make is usually modelled as a project in these crash reporting tools and crashes
are recorded with environment tag.

For environment tag, you can use name like _production_, _staging_, _customer-1_, _customer-4_, etc., to identify which
environment saw the crash. This tag name can be seen on your grafana dashboard, which you can use to query the logs.
