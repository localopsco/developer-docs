title: Eject out of LocalOps
---

There is no lock-in when you use LocalOps.

You can stop using LocalOps anytime. All infrastructure resources are provisioned in the cloud accounts you connect.

If you decide to stop using LocalOps, here are the steps and considerations to manage your environments and service
deployments independently.

## Considerations

- **Infrastructure Continuity**: Cloud resources including VPC, Subnets and Kubernetes cluster will continue to run on
  the same cloud account, even after ejecting from the platform.
- **Deployments**: To trigger deployments on services, developers can use `kubectl` to make manual deployments. Github
  Actions can also be configured to connect to the Kubernetes cluster and do the same on git-push. Or ArgoCD can be
  setup on the respective cluster, to automate this further.
- **Using IaC for Infrastructure**: If you choose to continue managing the infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
  (IaC) independently, you can import the existing resources created by LocalOps into your IaC tool's state. This allows
  you to maintain and update infrastructure resources using the respective IaC tool.
