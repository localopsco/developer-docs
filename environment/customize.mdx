title: Customise environment
---

Each app environment is provisioned with a set of network, compute and storage resources to support your application.

App environments are customisable via environment templates, to support different kinds of applications that would use
LocalOps to get deployed.

Our default environment template works for most applications. In case you want to customise more, please see below.

Environment templates can be created with custom:

- type of compute servers (as supported by cloud servers)
- compute/memory/gpu intensive
- count of servers
- application storage volume type
- application storage volume IOPS capacity
- application storage throughput
- application storage IOPS/GB

### Type of compute servers

Any type of compute server can be picked to match your application needs.

For AWS, all types of EC2 instances can be picked to run in your App environment. See
[AWS Supported EC2 types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

### Count of compute servers

Based on the size of your application, you can pick any count of compute servers to run in your App environment. These
many servers will be provisioned every time an app environment is provisioned and attached to the underlying kubernetes
cluster.

For AWS, we provision EC2 instances.

## Application storage

### Volume type

Based on the nature of I/O you do within your application, you can pick a volume type that gives best performance/price
ratio. This is the type of volume that will get provisioned for your application to read/write its data. Size of the
volume must be provided in your application Helm chart.

For AWS, you can pick any volume type supported. Refer
[AWS supported volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html).

### Volume IOPS

Based on the nature of I/O you do within your application, you can configure IOPS (I/O operations per second) bandwidth.
LocalOps configures volumes for this bandwidth while spinning up your application.

<Note>
  Higher IOPS values will result in higher cloud charges. Please refer to cloud provider (AWS) documentation before
  configuration
</Note>

### Volume storage throughput

Based on the nature of I/O you do within your application, you can configure storage throughput in GB/s. LocalOps
configures EBS volumes for this bandwidth while spinning up your application.

### Volume storage IOPS/GB

Based on the nature of I/O you do within your application, you can configure IOPS/GB. LocalOps configures EBS volumes
for this bandwidth while spinning up your application.

1. Click on **Environment templates** from the navigation pane on the left.
2. Click on the **Add template** button located at the top-right corner of the page.
3. Give a descriptive name for your template.
4. Select the cloud provider where the template will be used.
5. Specify the server configuration, including node type and quantity.
6. Define the storage settings required for your application.
7. Click the **Save Environment template** button to create your template.

### Update an environment template

1. Go to the **Environment templates** section from the navigation pane on the left.
2. Choose the template you want to update.
3. Adjust any parameters or configurations as needed.
4. Click on the **Save Changes** button to apply the updates to your template.

### Delete an environment template
