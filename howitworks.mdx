title: How it works
---

To deploy your code on a cloud account, LocalOps takes an environment-based approach.

After you connect your cloud account, you must create a new App environment for each of your deployment environments -
test, staging, production, etc.,

LocalOps will then provision the following set of exclusive cloud resources in the target cloud account to bring the
environment up and deploy your services inside.

- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Private subnets
- Public subnets
- Managed Kubernetes cluster (E.g., EKS in AWS)
- Mananged Compute servers and volumes (E.g., EC2 in AWS)
- Companion kubernetes deployments to support
  - Monitoring
  - Backups
- üëâ Your code run as "Services"
- Auto-renewing SSL certificate for the unique domain

We collectively refer to the above set as ‚Äú**App Environment**‚Äù.

LocalOps provisions app environments using standard in-house provisioning templates and scripts such that you can create
any number of app environments on any cloud account (AWS, Google Cloud or Azure) and any region.

### Kubernetes cluster

All your code is run as docker containers within the kubernetes cluster. Kubernets cluster is created, configured and
managed by LocalOps.

### Services

You must create a "Service" for each component of your application - backend, frontend, worker etc., to run your code
within the kubernetes cluster. You can configure a specific github repo and branch name for each service so that any
commit pushed to the branch will automatically get pulled by LocalOps and built & deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deployments

Deployments can be triggered either by pushing your code to the connected github/gitlab repository. Or by manually
triggering them from inside LocalOps dashboard.

### Monitoring

To debug issues, LocalOps provisions industry standard open source observability suite including Loki, Prometheus and
Grafana inside each environment. LocalOps provisions, configures these tools and connects them with each other, so that
your team can view Logs and Metrics in a single grafana dashboard, without any configuration. This suite is exclusively
provisioned for each app environment and runs inside the Kubernetes cluster, right next to your services.

### Cloud Credentials

LocalOps needs to have access to your cloud account, to programmatically create all cloud resources required to get the
app environment running. You can connect your cloud account via keyless, role-based access method from Connections
section.

### Exclusive Infrastructure

Each app environment get its own exclusive set of kubernetes cluster, compute servers and other resources listed above.
This is ideal for providing maximum Network, Data & Compute isolation between your deployments & customers.

<Note>
All cloud infrastructure to run an app environment is provisioned in the cloud account chosen while creating the app
environment inside LocalOps. The underlying cloud account will be billed by the cloud provider (say AWS) for the
resources running within each app environment. Cloud account's owner has to pay for these charges separately with the
cloud provider. If the cloud account belongs to your customer, they would pay for these cloud resources.
</Note>

### Security Best Practices:

Within each app environment, LocalOps turns ON all security best practices suggested by the respective cloud provider.
In AWS for example, security groups, disk encryption etc., are all enabled by default.
