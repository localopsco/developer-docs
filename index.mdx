**LocalOps** lets you get Vercel-like PaaS experience on any AWS/GCP/Azure account in minutes. LocalOps provisions
production grade app environments, sets up CI/CD, monitoring and everything else, so that you can simply connect your
Github repo and start deploying code. No need to learn, setup or configure cloud environments yourself.

You can use LocalOps to launch on your cloud or your customer cloud (if you are offering "Bring your own cloud"
capability to customers). [Talk to us](https://go.localops.co/meet).
