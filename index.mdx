**LocalOps** lets you get Vercel-like PaaS experience on any AWS/GCP/Azure account in minutes. LocalOps provisions
production grade app environments, sets up CI/CD, monitoring and everything else, so that you can simply connect your
Github repo and start deploying code. No need to learn, setup or configure cloud environments yourself.

capability to customers). [Talk to us](https://go.localops.co/meet).
