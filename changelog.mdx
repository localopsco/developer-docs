<Update label="Jan 27th, 2025">
## See CloudWatch metrics/logs in one place

When we provision app environment, we provision a Grafana dashboard specific to the app environment, accessible at
monitor. `<your-app-env-domain>`. You can access metrics and logs of all nodes, pods and containers running within the
app environment's kubernetes cluster.

If you are running your app environment in AWS, you will also see a pre-configured CloudWatch data source in the
corresponding Grafana dashboard. You can access logs and metrics that are stored in CloudWatch.

This is super useful if your application is using managed AWS services that are sending metrics/logs to CloudWatch.

Go to ‚ÄúMonitor‚Äù tab in your app environment to access the Grafana dashboard. Within Grafana, see Connections > Data
sources to see the Cloudwatch data source. Click on ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù next to it to see CloudWatch logs and metrics.

Let us know what you think. Email us at help@localops.co.

## Standard retention policy set on all logs and metrics

Every app environment comes with its own unique instance of Loki + Prometheus + Grafana stack. From now, all logs and
metrics recorded by the monitoring stack have 30-day retention policy. Any log statement/metric data point is
automatically deleted after 30 days.

This significantly reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks when developers print sensitive information on logs by
accident.

## Access any AWS managed service using IAM Role

Your app container running inside App environment can now access any AWS service using IAM roles. You don‚Äôt have to
configure any IAM key/credential as secrets in your application.

LocalOps sets up a default IAM role when your app environment is provisioned in the target AWS account. We set things up
in your app environment such that your application will be able to use this IAM role implicitly via AWS SDK, if you
declare the `ServiceAccount` in your Helm deployment yaml spec as per our documentation.

After the app environment is provisioned, you can manually add/remove relevant IAM policies to the app specific IAM role
we provisioned earlier.

## Scale app environments

![Scaling](./images/changelog/scaling-jan-14-25.png)

You can now scale up/down the underlying servers powering your app environment, manually from within LocalOps console.

Visit ‚ÄúScaling‚Äù tab in your App environment page to pick a supported Node type (EC2 instance type in case of AWS) and
save. Existing worker nodes will be seamlessly replaced by new set of worker nodes.

You can also set a higher number of Node count. New worker nodes wll get provisioned automatically within a minute or
two.

## Pass Encrypted Secrets

![Secrets](./images/changelog/secrets-dec-2-24.png)

Pass API keys, certificates, auth token and other confidential information to your app environment as secrets from
within Vars tab. All secrets are encrypted and stored in the destination/target cloud account and later get passed
inside the Kubernetes cluster as encrypted secrets.

Pass up to 100 key value pairs as secrets. Learn more at https://localops.co/blog/manage-application-secrets.

## Connect to AWS without IAM keys

![Connection](./images/changelog/connection-oct-16-24.png)

We no longer accept IAM access keys to connect to AWS accounts.

We have shipped a new secure 1-click setup process to connect to AWS accounts using IAM roles and OIDC protocol. This
ensures that all access is done using short term keys created and destroyed by AWS.

AWS accounts can be connected using 1-click from Connections tab. Learn more at https://docs.localops.co/accounts/aws

## Introducing LocalOps CLI v1

If you want to inspect your app environment & its backing kubernetes cluster, say to check if your application‚Äôs pods
are running healthy, use Localops CLI to do it.

Just install it in your local dev machine and use its update-kubeconfig sub-command to set correct kubernetes context of
your local kubectl system. Then, you can run any kubectl command to inspect objects running in the specific app
environment's kubernetes cluster.

Checkout the new `Shell` tab in App environment page to find out more üòé.

![Shell](./images/changelog/shell-aug-13-24.png)

Run this command in your Terminal to install LocalOps CLI in your Mac:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cli.localops.co/install.sh)"
```
