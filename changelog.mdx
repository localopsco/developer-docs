<Update label="Jan 27th, 2025">
  ## See CloudWatch metrics/logs in one place

  When we provision environment, we provision a Grafana dashboard specific to the environment, accessible at
  monitor. `<your-app-env-domain>`. You can access metrics and logs of all nodes, pods and containers running within the
  environment's kubernetes cluster.

  If you are running your environment in AWS, you will also see a pre-configured CloudWatch data source in the
  corresponding Grafana dashboard. You can access logs and metrics that are stored in CloudWatch.

  This is super useful if your application is using managed AWS services that are sending metrics/logs to CloudWatch.

  Go to “Monitor” tab in your environment to access the Grafana dashboard. Within Grafana, see Connections \> Data sources to see the Cloudwatch data source. Click on “Explore” next to it to see CloudWatch logs and metrics.

  Let us know what you think. Email us at [help@localops.co](mailto:help@localops.co).

  ## Standard retention policy set on all logs and metrics

  Every environment comes with its own unique instance of Loki \+ Prometheus \+ Grafana stack. From now, all logs and metrics recorded by the monitoring stack have 30-day retention policy. Any log statement/metric data point is automatically deleted after 30 days.

  This significantly reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks when developers print sensitive information on logs by
  accident.

  ## Access any AWS managed service using IAM Role

  Your app container running inside App environment can now access any AWS service using IAM roles. You don’t have to
  configure any IAM key/credential as secrets in your application.

  LocalOps sets up a default IAM role when your environment is provisioned in the target AWS account. We set things up
  in your environment such that your application will be able to use this IAM role implicitly via AWS SDK, if you
  declare the `ServiceAccount` in your Helm deployment yaml spec as per our documentation.

  After the environment is provisioned, you can manually add/remove relevant IAM policies to the app specific IAM role
  we provisioned earlier.
