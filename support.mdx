### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will App environments continue to run after I stop using LocalOps?">
    Yes. When you stop using LocalOps, app environments are left as they are, for your team to manage them manually or
    by other means. Check [how to eject](/environment/eject) to learn more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does LocalOps make all of my Application run in multiple cloud providers automatically?">
    Yes, if you have containerised your application and made a a Kubernetes Helm Chart for it. However, if you use
    managed cloud services such as Amazon S3, you are supposed to provide alternate implementations to run in other
    cloud providers such as GCP or Azure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use any DB for my application?">
    Yes. Unlike PaaS services such as Heroku, you are free to pick and use any database to build your application. As
    long as you can find a docker image for it to declare it within Helm Chart as your dependency, LocalOps can spin up
    an App environment with that database, in any cloud.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a Single Page Application (SPA) framework?">
    Yes. You are free to pick any SPA framework to build your Front end. Check [Single page apps](/guides/spa/all) to
    learn more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I obfuscate/hide my code when it runs in customer's cloud?">
    There is no fool-proof technical way to hide/obfuscate your code. If your service is written in compiled languages,
    it helps. Otherwise we'd suggest you to address this legally in your Services agreement with customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I calculate the hosting charges for the resources provisioned in target cloud account?">
    LocalOps tags all cloud infrastructure resources by two standard names. `*-id` and `*-name`. You can locate them in App
    Environment settings page. Using these tags, anyone can filter down AWS resources in AWS console and find out their
    cost.

    LocalOps will soon show a monthly cost estimator under each app environment's details page.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who pays for the cloud infrastructure resources created by LocalOps?">
    LocalOps creates App environments on the connected cloud accounts. Owners of the cloud account are billed by cloud
    provider for the resources provisioned.
