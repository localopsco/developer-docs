### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a lock-in? Will environments continue to run after I stop using LocalOps?">
    No. There is no lock-in at all. When you stop using LocalOps, environments are left as they are, in your cloud, for your team to start managing them. Check [how to eject](/environment/eject) to learn more.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I use any DB for my application?">
    Yes. You are free to provision any database you need for your services. Just add their HOST, PORT, Username and Password as secrets within your Service settings. They will be passed down as environment variable for your containers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a Single Page Application (SPA) framework?">
    Yes. You can use any SPA framework to build your Front end. Refer to these guides - [React](/guides/spa/react), [Angular](/guides/spa/angular), [Ember](/guides/spa/ember), [VueJS](/guides/spa/vue) to learn more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does LocalOps make all of my Application run in multiple cloud providers automatically?">
    Yes, if you have containerised your application and have a Dockerfile for it. However, if you use managed cloud services such as Amazon S3, you must provide alternate implementations to run in other cloud providers such as GCP or Azure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I obfuscate/hide my code if environments run in my customer's cloud account?">
    There is no fool-proof technical way to hide/obfuscate your code. If your service is written in compiled languages,it helps. Otherwise we'd suggest you to address this legally in your Service agreement with your customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I calculate the hosting charges for the resources provisioned in target cloud account?">
    LocalOps tags all cloud infrastructure resources by two standard names. `*-id` and `*-name`. You can locate them in Environment dashboard. Using these tags, you can filter cloud resources in AWS console, either in Cost management console or Resource explorer and find out their cost. LocalOps will soon show a monthly cost estimator under each environment's details page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who pays for the cloud infrastructure resources created by LocalOps?">
    LocalOps provisions environments on cloud accounts you connect. Account administrators of the respective cloud account have to pay the bills raised by cloud provider.
